Once the user submits a response to an instance of a survey, there is no need to display that instance again (because of concurrency issues there will be a need to keep track of the survey ID mobile side)<br />\n----- Keep in mind it is possible to display multiple surveys in the same session<br />\n- The user should not be able to circumvent the survey by logging in to multiple devices or by any other means<br />\n----- After filling out the survey on one device, there is no need to update the other device. It is acceptable that the user fill out the survey twice or restart the app in order to get past the lockout screen<br />\n- Again, a reminder&hellip; the intention is to build a robust messaging system to be used as the backbone for future functionality.<br /><br />\nNOTE: The Proposal Bid should be accurate.
